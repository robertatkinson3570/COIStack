When a vendor's employee slips on a wet floor in your building and files a claim, or a subcontractor's work causes water damage to a tenant's unit, the question of liability comes down to one thing: whether your organization is listed as an additional insured on the vendor's policy. For property managers overseeing hundreds or thousands of units, verifying additional insured endorsements across every vendor relationship is one of the most consequential compliance tasks you face.

## What Is an Additional Insured Endorsement?

An additional insured endorsement is an amendment to a commercial general liability (CGL) policy that extends coverage to a party other than the named insured. When your property management company is added as an additional insured on a vendor's policy, you gain the right to file claims under that policy for losses arising from the vendor's operations at your properties.

This is distinct from simply being named in a certificate of insurance. A COI is a snapshot document that confirms coverage exists, but it does not confer rights under the policy. Only the endorsement itself, attached to the actual policy, provides the legal protection you need.

## Why Additional Insured Status Matters

Without proper additional insured endorsements, your organization bears the full cost of defending and settling claims that originate from vendor activities. Consider a few common scenarios:

- **A janitorial contractor's employee injures a tenant.** Without additional insured status, your property's own liability policy responds first, driving up your loss history and premiums.
- **An HVAC subcontractor causes a fire during a repair.** If you are not an additional insured, recovery from the vendor's insurer requires a separate subrogation action, which is slow and uncertain.
- **A landscaping crew damages a visitor's vehicle.** Additional insured coverage lets you tender the claim directly to the vendor's carrier.

For portfolios managing 200 to 2,000 units with dozens or hundreds of active vendor contracts, the aggregate exposure from unverified endorsements can reach millions of dollars annually.

## Common Endorsement Forms to Know

The Insurance Services Office (ISO) publishes standardized endorsement forms. The ones most relevant to property managers include:

- **CG 20 10** -- Covers ongoing operations only. This is the most commonly requested form and protects you while the vendor is actively performing work.
- **CG 20 37** -- Covers completed operations. This is essential for construction and renovation vendors, where claims often surface after work is finished.
- **CG 20 26** -- A designated person or organization endorsement that names you specifically rather than using blanket language.

Best practice is to require both CG 20 10 and CG 20 37 from any vendor performing physical work on your properties. Blanket additional insured endorsements can simplify administration but should be confirmed with the carrier to ensure your specific entities are covered.

## Verification Challenges at Scale

Manual verification of additional insured endorsements is where most property management companies fall behind. The process typically involves requesting the actual endorsement page from the vendor or their broker, comparing the named entities against your legal entity structure, and confirming the endorsement form number matches your contract requirements.

When you are managing 50 to 500 vendor relationships, each with annual renewals and potential mid-term policy changes, this creates thousands of verification events per year. Common failure points include:

- Vendors providing COIs without the underlying endorsement attached
- Endorsement language that names the wrong legal entity or property address
- Outdated endorsements that reference expired policy numbers
- Blanket endorsements with exclusions that carve out your type of property

## Building a Reliable Endorsement Verification Process

A structured approach to endorsement management starts with clear contractual language. Your vendor agreements should specify the exact endorsement forms required, the legal entities to be named, and the obligation to provide endorsement copies -- not just certificates.

From there, tracking and verification should be systematized. Whether you use dedicated COI management software or a structured internal process, every vendor file should include the endorsement document itself, a record of when it was last verified, and an alert for upcoming policy renewals that will require re-verification.

Automated document extraction technology can accelerate this process significantly by reading endorsement forms, identifying the named entities and form numbers, and flagging discrepancies against your requirements. This reduces the per-vendor verification time from minutes to seconds and ensures nothing slips through during peak renewal periods.

## The Bottom Line

Additional insured endorsements are not a paperwork formality. They are the mechanism that transfers financial risk from your properties to the vendors whose work creates that risk. For property managers operating at scale, systematic verification of these endorsements is one of the highest-return compliance activities available.
