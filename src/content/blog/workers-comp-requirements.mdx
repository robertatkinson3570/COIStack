# Workers' Compensation Insurance: What Property Managers Need to Know

Workers' Compensation insurance occupies a unique position in vendor compliance. Unlike general liability, which is governed primarily by contracts and industry standards, Workers' Comp is a statutory requirement in nearly every state. The rules vary by jurisdiction, the penalties for non-compliance are severe, and the financial exposure for property managers who fail to verify coverage can be substantial.

## What Workers' Compensation Covers

Workers' Compensation insurance provides benefits to employees who are injured or become ill as a result of their job duties. Benefits typically include:

- **Medical expenses.** Hospital bills, physician fees, prescription drugs, rehabilitation, and related costs for treating the work-related injury or illness.
- **Lost wages.** A percentage of the worker's regular income during the period they are unable to work, subject to state-mandated maximums.
- **Disability benefits.** Compensation for permanent impairments resulting from the workplace injury.
- **Death benefits.** Payments to the dependents of a worker who dies as a result of a work-related injury or illness.

In exchange for these guaranteed benefits, employees generally forfeit the right to sue their employer for workplace injuries. This trade-off -- known as the "grand bargain" of Workers' Compensation -- provides certainty for both parties.

## Why It Matters to Property Managers

Here is the critical point that many property managers overlook: the Workers' Compensation grand bargain protects the employer-employee relationship. It does not automatically protect you as the property owner or manager.

When a vendor's employee is injured on your property and the vendor lacks Workers' Compensation coverage, the injured worker retains the right to pursue legal action against third parties -- including you. In practice, this means:

- The injured worker's attorney will name your management company and the property owner in the lawsuit.
- You will bear defense costs, which accumulate regardless of the outcome.
- If the court finds that conditions on your property contributed to the injury, you may be liable for damages that would otherwise have been covered by the vendor's Workers' Comp policy.

Even in states with strong employer liability protections, the absence of Workers' Comp coverage at the vendor level creates a direct pathway to your balance sheet.

## State-by-State Variations

Workers' Compensation requirements are not uniform across states. Key variables include:

- **Coverage thresholds.** Some states require Workers' Comp for any employer with one or more employees. Others set the threshold at three, four, or five employees. Texas allows most private employers to opt out of the system entirely, though doing so exposes the employer -- and potentially you -- to tort liability.
- **Sole proprietor and independent contractor exemptions.** Many states exempt sole proprietors and independent contractors from mandatory Workers' Comp coverage. However, misclassification is rampant, and a worker classified as a contractor may be reclassified as an employee by a state agency or court.
- **Industry-specific requirements.** Construction trades are frequently subject to stricter Workers' Comp requirements, with lower or no employee-count thresholds.
- **Proof of coverage formats.** Most states accept the standard ACORD certificate, but some require state-specific filings or certificates from the state Workers' Comp authority.

Because your vendors may operate across multiple states, you need to verify that their coverage applies in the jurisdiction where your properties are located.

## What to Verify on the COI

When reviewing a vendor's COI for Workers' Compensation compliance, confirm the following:

- **Part A -- Workers' Compensation.** This section confirms the vendor carries statutory Workers' Comp coverage. It should indicate the states where coverage applies. Look for the specific state or "All States" designation.
- **Part B -- Employers' Liability.** This section provides additional coverage for employer liability claims that fall outside the statutory Workers' Comp system. Standard limits are $500,000 per accident, $500,000 per employee for disease, and $500,000 policy limit for disease. Your requirements may be higher.
- **Policy dates.** As with general liability, confirm the policy is active during the period the vendor will be performing work.
- **Carrier information.** The insurer should be a licensed Workers' Comp carrier in the applicable state. Some states operate monopolistic state funds that are the exclusive source of Workers' Comp coverage.

## Handling Exemptions

When a vendor claims they are exempt from Workers' Compensation requirements -- typically because they are a sole proprietor with no employees -- proceed carefully. Request a signed affidavit or state-issued exemption certificate. Some states offer formal exemption registrations that vendors can provide as proof.

Even with a valid exemption, consider the practical risk. If a sole proprietor is injured on your property and has no Workers' Comp coverage, they may pursue a premises liability claim against you. Some property managers require sole proprietors to carry occupational accident insurance or to sign a waiver acknowledging their exempt status.

## Building Workers' Comp Into Your Vendor Program

Workers' Compensation verification should be a non-negotiable component of your vendor onboarding process. Include the requirement in your vendor agreements, specify minimum Employers' Liability limits, and set up monitoring to catch lapses before they create exposure.

For property managers with vendors across multiple states, maintaining a reference matrix of state-specific requirements ensures you are applying the correct standards. This is one area where the regulatory landscape changes frequently, so review your matrix annually with qualified legal or insurance counsel.

The bottom line is straightforward: every vendor who sends employees to your properties should carry active Workers' Compensation coverage, and you should verify that coverage before work begins and continuously thereafter.
